Performance Audit Analysis & Root Cause Investigation
====================================================

Based on the comprehensive performance audit results, this script analyzes the root causes
of the performance issues and develops specific optimization strategies.

Key Findings from Audit:
- RTF Performance: 0/4 tests passed (target ≤0.25)
- Primary Bottleneck: Model inference (6.132s average, 99.7% of total time)
- Secondary Issues: Memory leaks, CPU underutilization
- Current RTF Range: 0.6-21.2 (extremely poor for short texts)
