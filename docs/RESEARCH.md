### **2. Strategic Recommendations & Methodology**

Based on the analysis, the following architecture and methodology are recommended.

#### **2.1 Recommended Tech Stack for JabberTTS API**

| **Layer** | **Recommended Technology** | **Rationale** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **API Server** | **FastAPI** | Modern, async, high-performance, easy to document. Industry standard for Python APIs. |
| **Inference Engine** | **Coqui TTS Python API** | Provides a mature framework for loading models, running synthesis, and managing voice cloning. |  |
| **Core Model** | **OpenAudio S1-mini (Optimized)** | Our chosen balance of quality and size. Target for quantization. |
| **Text Preprocessor** | **eSpeak-NG** (via `phonemizer`) | Offload linguistic complexity from the neural model. Convert input text to phonemes for more robust pronunciation. |  |
| **Audio Encoding/Streaming**| **FFmpeg** (via `ffmpeg-python`) | Industry standard for converting raw audio to efficient formats like MP3 for streaming. |
| **Optimization Format** | **ONNX Runtime** | High-performance cross-platform inference accelerator. Our primary path for CPU optimization. |

#### **2.2 Development Methodology & Best Practices**

1.  **Prototype First, Optimize Second:**
    *   **Step 1:** Build a functional but unoptimized prototype using the raw Coqui TTS API and the original OpenAudio S1-mini model. This validates the entire pipeline: text input -> model -> audio output -> API response.
    *   **Step 2:** Integrate `eSpeak-NG` for text pre-processing. This can improve accuracy and potentially allow for a more aggressive model optimization later.
    *   **Step 3:** Once the pipeline works, begin the iterative optimization process (quantization, pruning, ONNX conversion).

2.  **Embrace a Validation-First Mindset:**
    *   **Benchmark Religiously:** Before any optimization, establish baselines for Quality (Mean Opinion Score - MOS, Word Error Rate - WER) and Performance (Real-Time Factor - RTF, RAM usage).
    *   **Automate Testing:** Create scripts that run your test suite after every change. This instantly tells you if an optimization improved RTF at the cost of unacceptable quality loss.
    *   **Use Objective and Subjective Metrics:**
        *   **WER:** Use `Whisper.cpp` or OpenAI's Whisper to transcribe generated audio and compare it to the input text.
        *   **MOS:** Conduct small-scale blind listening tests with humans to gauge naturalness and similarity.

3.  **Optimization Hierarchy for CPU:**
    This is the core technical challenge. Follow this order of operations:
    1.  **Pruning:** Use standard PyTorch tools to remove redundant weights from the model (e.g., `torch.nn.utils.prune`). Aim for a 10-15% size reduction.
    2.  **Quantization (Post-Training):** Use ONNX Runtime's dynamic quantization tools. This converts weights to INT8 but keeps activations in FP32, offering a good speedup on CPU with minimal quality loss.
    3.  **Aggressive Quantization (Unsloth-inspired):** *If more compression is needed,* implement a custom mixed-bit strategy (e.g., 4-bit for most layers, 8-bit for sensitive output layers) *before* converting to ONNX. This is the most complex but rewarding step.
    4.  **ONNX Conversion & Graph Optimization:** Convert the final quantized model to ONNX. ONNX Runtime will then apply graph optimizations (operator fusion, constant folding) that can further improve performance.
    4.  **Core Inference:** Use **ONNX Runtime** (`CPUExecutionProvider`) for the final, optimized inference, as it is highly tuned for CPU execution.

4.  **API Design Best Practices:**
    *   **OpenAI Compatibility:** Ensure your `/v1/audio/speech` endpoint accepts the same parameters (`model`, `voice`, `input`, `response_format`) and returns the same responses as OpenAI.
    *   **Streaming Response:** Implement response streaming using FastAPI's `StreamingResponse`. Encode audio to MP3 in chunks as it's generated and stream it immediately to the client. This dramatically reduces perceived latency.
    *   **Request Queuing:** Implement a simple in-memory queue to handle burst traffic and prevent the CPU-bound inference engine from being overwhelmed.
